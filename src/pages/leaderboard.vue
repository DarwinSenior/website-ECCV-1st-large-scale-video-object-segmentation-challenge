      p We evaluate our PReMVOS algorithm (Proposal-generation, Refinement and Merging for Video Object Segmentation) on the new YouTube-VOS dataset for the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). This task consists of automatically generating accurate and consistent pixel masks for multiple objects in a video sequence, given the objectâ€™s first-frame ground truth annotations. The new YouTube-VOS dataset and the corresponding challenge, the 1st Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge, provide a much larger scale evaluation than any previous VOS benchmarks. Our method achieves the best results in the 2018 Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge with a J&F overall mean score over both known and unknown categories of 72.2.

      p Proposal, Tracking & Segmentation (PTS): A cascaded network for video object segmentation
      p We propose a novel video object segmentation architecture which can capture long-term temporal information and handle scale variance in objects.
      p The proposed architecture consists of three components: Region Proposal Network, Object Tracking Network, and Reference-Guided Segmentation Network. The Region Proposal Network is pre-trained on COCO dataset and provides object candidate boxes. Inspired by MDNet, Object Tracking Network is designed to score the candidate boxes and updated online for adapting to large and fast changes in object appearance. Then, the box with the highest score is selected to crop and resize the frame for normalizing the scale variation of objects. Finally, Reference-Guided Segmentation Network will make use of both cropped region with previous mask and the reference frame to segment target object.
      p Besides YouTube-VOS dataset, COCO dataset is used to pre-train Region Proposal Network in this competition.

      p Our method consists of two major modules, mask propagation module and re-identification module. Our mask propagation module is built based on flownet2, while taking multiple previous frames and its corresponding masks as guidance to train a flow-appearance propagation network for masks propagation between adjacent frames. For re-identification module, we train a network to generate a 128-dim feature for each position, following the paper "Blazingly Fast Video Object Segmentation with Pixel-Wise Metric Learning". For any two foreground objects, we calculate the number of pixels whose distances to the foreground object in the first image is smaller than that of the background pixels. This indicates similarity degree of two objects. In the inference process, the mask propagated from the previous frame and masks generated by the mask-rcnn are treated as the candidate masks. Then the flownet2 and re-identification modules are used to calculate the appearance and motion consistency for each mask. Finally, the masks with highest score is set to the prediction of current frame. No online training is used in our method. Our method achieve 69.7% in validation set and 69.9% in test set.

      p A combined approach of meta-learning and mask propagation is used for the competition. Basically, the given target objects of a video are tracked by a fine-tuned neural network with given first frame annotation. Yet, the finetuning process is fast and effective because we used a meta-trained network using REPTILE meta-learning framework. Afterward, the output mask from the finetuned network is enhanced with another neural network in which its input is a channel-wise concatenation of (the previous frame, the previous frame prediction, current frame, current frame prediction by the finetuned network). For both of the network, we used a PSP-network pretrained for VOC 2012. The given frames of videos are preprocessed with various operations (crop, reflection, etc..) for training and frames are resized to 600x1200.

      p We propose an online video segmentation method for temporal images. Our online video segmentation with Mask-RCNN and Re-id (OVSMAR) model includes an online mask propagation module, a Mask-RCNN module and a Object-Reid module. The online mask propagation module takes the warped prediction result of the previous frame together with the optical flow as input, and outputs the segmentation result of the current frame. This process can be trained end-to-end online with continuous images. Starting from weights pre-trained on ImageNet, COCO and PASCAL VOC, we train this module on Youtube Datasets online. We use the Re-id module to retrieve instances which are missing due to occlusion, motion blur, and out of the camera. We use the Mask-RCNN module trained on MS-COCO to find the missing object which similarity is greater than the threshold, then use the Mask-RCNN segmentation result as the coarse prediction of the object for online mask propagation module, and propagate both forward and backward.      With these three modules iteratively applied, our OVSMAR records a global mean (Region Jaccard and Boundary F measure) of 0.678 on valid dataset and 0.672 on test set.

      p We first train model on the trainset to distinguish the general object, then fine-tune the model on the augment data of the first frame of the testset videos to distinguish the specific object,  and finally complete the inference with the object tracking bbox.

      p We propose a semantic warping-based video object segmentation (SWVOS) method in the 1st Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge 2018. It firstly addresses the problem of generating fine bounding box for each object, and then produces accurate pixel proposal with a mask-refinement network. More specifically, 1) the mask of an annotated object is warped into other frames.  Considering that the accuracy of warped masks differs due to the deformations, occlusions, and intensity changes in videos, a Warping Confidence approach is proposed to differentiate the warped masks. 2) The warped masks with a high confidence, i.e., within a fine bounding box, are directly fed into a mask-refinement network to get the proposal masks. 3) The others are coped with to obtain fine bounding boxes: those with a middle confidence are put into a coarse-to-fine (CTF) bounding box pipeline, and those with a low confidence are re-warped using a semantics-selection (SEMS) method. For semantics, the Youtube-2018 dataset and COCO dataset are applied for training. Additionally, when occlusion occurs in CTF and SEMS, a few random frames from previous frames are used to detect and/or rewarp. 4) Multiple proposal masks in each video are merged by taking into account the warping confidence. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the large-scale Youtube-2018 dataset.
